      answer:
        "As a minimum, the congestion status of each of the 24 sections we’ve divided the beach up into is updated three times a day: typically around 9am, 1pm and 5pm. The 9am update presents a prediction for the day ahead.",

      question: "Does the App collect my personal details?",

        "How do you collect data to update the beach congestion levels?",

      question:
        "Why does the App show crowded beaches in the evening and at night?",

        "Tap on any section of the beach map within the app and you will be presented with essential information on cycling, dog exercise and BBQ permissions. Information on whether there is a public toilet open nearby is also displayed along with whether the beach is lifeguarded. You can also use the search function to scroll through and go straight to any of our 24 sections of beach.",

        "Are there any plans to develop the functionality of the App in the future?",
      answer:
        "Yes. We have just secured funding to develop the next evolution of the App. This will allow the app the automatically draw off data from footfall sensors, CCTV and weather to provide ‘live’ updates every hour. We also have ambitions to show car park availability and greater levels of information around amenities across the seafront from toilet opening times to café and restaurant details. These will take a little time to develop, so please bear with us.",

        "Why aren’t the beaches and public areas within Poole and Christchurch harbour included?",
      answer:
        "For now, the App is heavily reliant on visual observation for updates. Our team do not patrol the harbour areas and so we cannot at the moment provide reliable congestion information.",
